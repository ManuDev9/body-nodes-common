Bodynodes repository for the BnCommon module

This repository will contain all the modules in charge of:

- higher level computation for our custom motion capture

There will be packages for python, java, csharp, and cpp, along with data to test them.

Check for the language supported versioning in each folder. If detailed info is not provided,
feel free to test the code in your environment and add your versions in the supported_version.txt
file. Raise an issue if you find any problems.
